# Store Project

Contributions:
We managed to balance the workload efficiently, each working on portions and sending them back and forth, or coding together as partners. I worked on the initial setup of Django, Christine got the html up and running, and the functionality was split equally between the two of us.

Major Challenges:
There is always an issue of outside work; neither of us are slackers in our courses, so balancing this project with the remainder of our workload was tricky. Beyond that, linking the pages, setting up order forms, and fully understanding the inner workings of Django were our major issues.

Programming Practices:
We started off sending an obscene amount of zip files back and forth to edit them on our own terms before eventually using the beauty of github. We had partner coding sessions, talked strategy the entire process, and coded like the wizards we are.
